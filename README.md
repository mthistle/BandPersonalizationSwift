# BandPersonalizationSwift
Swift version of the Microsoft Band Kit sample app BandPersonalization. This sample will change your Band's Me Tile to a custom image. To reset the image back to the default images use the [Microsoft Health App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-health/id912580285?mt=8), available in the AppStore.

This is a port of the BandPersonalization example from the Microsoft Band Kit SDK for iOS samples. The SDK can be found at http://developer.microsoftband.com/

## Dependencies

Uses the Microsoft Band Kit (MSB) for iOS (included). You can get the latest version from: http://developer.microsoftband.com/
Demonstrates use of MSB with Swift. Written with Swift 1.2 and Xcode 6.3 Beta.

Requires a Microsoft Band paired with your iPhone (there is no simulator, you need a physical band).
